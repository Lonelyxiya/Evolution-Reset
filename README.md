Evolution Modpack
Introduction
Evolution is the first integration package I've made since I approached Minecraft, co-produced by me and Laz. Mainly inspired by the evolutionary history of human beings, it is committed to allowing players to experience the real process of primitive survival and the development of the times. Compared with the original Minecraft, because of the addition of the "Tinder Technology" module, the time in the early stage of the game is greatly extended, and the difficulty of the game is also greatly increased.
