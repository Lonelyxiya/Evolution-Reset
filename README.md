Brief
Herodotus is a deep-tweaked extreme Minecraft modpack that mixed magic and technology together. Based on Minecraft 1.12.2 with Forge, mainly made with CraftTweaker2, FTBQuests.

The name "Herodotus" came from a Greek historian. Herodotus recorded half-truths and half-falses in his book "Histories", just like the mix of magic and technology!
